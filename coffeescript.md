## Banned features and gotchas

### Banned features

  - Coffee classes
  - `with`
  - `eval`
  - `new Array`
  - `new Object`
  - `__proto__`
  - Modifying native objects or their prototypes

### Gotchas

CoffeeScript implicitly returns from every function and statement. This is a problem for constructor functions (which shouldn't return anything) and functions that might produce complex return values by accident. To avoid this problem, always write an explicit `return` at the end of function constructors and functions that end in a loop or conditional.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  Color = (@name, @hex) ->
    @rgb = hexToRgb hex

  # Yes
  Color = (@name, @hex) ->
    @rgb = hexToRgb hex
    return

  # No
  eatEach = (items) ->
    for item in items
      eat item

  # Yes
  eatEach = (items) ->
    for item in items
      eat item
    return
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**


## Naming

  - *lowerCamelCase* - Local variables and functions as well as public properties or functions
  - *_underscoreCamelCase* - Internal properties or functions
  - *UpperCamelCase* - Constructor functions
  - *SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE* - Constants
  - *dashed-lower* - HTML ids, classes, and attribute names

When camelcasing acronyms, always treat them like words. For example: `htmlSection` or `newHtml`

Avoid [reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words) as property names.

### Abbreviations

Do not abbreviate variable or function names unless they are explicitly listed here. If an abbreviation is listed here, always use it instead of the full word.

Generic abbreviations:

  - `err` - Error arguments in callbacks and catch
  - `cb` - Callback
  - `i` - Index
  - `e` - HTML event object
  - `el` - HTML element
  - `fn` - Variable representing a function

Abbreviations especially for use in Share and Racer:

  - `op` - Operation
  - `doc` - Data document
  - `v` - Version
  - `txn` - Transaction
  - `db` - Database

When iterators are nested or functions that take a callback are nested, use specific names for the different callbacks or indices.

## Whitespace

  - Two space indentation
  - No trailing line whitespace
  - No whitespace on empty lines
  - Has extra linebreak at end of file

### Indentation

Indent statements continued between lines one level (two spaces). Place operators that continue a line at the end of the line.

``` coffeescript
  greeting = if isNew
      'Welcome!'
    else
      'Welcome back!'

  farewell = 'Come back to our place soon ' +
    user.firstName
```

In chained method calls that don't fit on a single line, place each call on a separate line and indented by one level, with a leading `.`.

```coffeescript
  [1..3]
    .map((x) -> x * x)
    .concat([10..12])
    .filter((x) -> x < 11)
    .reduce((x, y) -> x + y)
```

Do not vertically align items in consecutive lines.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  x        = 0
  y        = 0
  position = 'top'

  # No
  magicWords = [
                 'abracadabra'
                 'gesundheit'
                 'ventrilo'
               ]

  # No
  message = if regExp.test text
              'You have a match!'
            else
              'No match'

  # Yes
  x = 0
  y = 0
  position = 'top'

  # Yes
  magicWords = [
    'abracadabra'
    'gesundheit'
    'ventrilo'
  ]

  # Yes
  message = if regExp.test text
      'You have a match!'
    else
      'No match'
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**


## Punctuation

Prefer single quoted strings (`''`) instead of double quoted (`""`) strings, unless string interpolation is being used for the given string.

Omit parentheses around function calls that begin an expression. However, when nesting or at all ambiguous, use parentheses for clarity.

``` coffeescript
  # Parentheses omitted

  app.get '/', (req, res) ->
    res.send 'Hi!'

  launch spaceship, coordinates

  name = model.get 'name'

  return cb err if err

  # Parentheses included

  out = Math.max 0, Math.min(1, value)

  text = prefix + model.get('message')
```

Do not use Lisp-like function grouping style.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  text = prefix + (model.get 'message')
```

Do not use parentheses when declaring functions that accept no arguments.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  bar = () ->
  # Yes
  bar = ->
```

Use curly braces when creating object literals on a single line. While this is optional in CoffeScript, we think it is generally more clear and readable to include the curly braces.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  singers = Jagger: "Rock", Elvis: "Roll"
  client = createClient port: 3000

  # Yes
  singers = {Jagger: "Rock", Elvis: "Roll"}
  client = createClient {port: 3000}
```

Use `@property` instead of `this.property`.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  this.property
  # Yes
  @property
```

However, avoid using **standalone** `@`:

``` coffeescript
  # No
  return @
  # Yes
  return this
```

Prefer shorthand notation (`::`) for accessing an object's prototype:

``` coffeescript
  # No
  Array.prototype.slice
  # Yes
  Array::slice
```

## Comments

The first word of the comment should be capitalized, unless the first word is an identifier that begins with a lower-case letter. If a comment is short, the period at the end can be omitted.

### Block Comments

Block comments apply to the block of code that follows them.

Each line of a block comment starts with a `#` and a single space, and should be indented at the same level of the code that it describes.

Paragraphs inside of block comments are separated by a line containing a single `#`.

``` coffeescript
  # This is a block comment. Note that if this were a real block
  # comment, we would actually be describing the proceeding code.
  #
  # This is the second paragraph of the same block comment. Note
  # that this paragraph was separated from the previous paragraph
  # by a line containing a single comment character.
  start()
  stop()
```

### Inline Comments

Place inline comments on the line immediately above the statements they are describing. Do not place inline comments on the same line unless it aids in clarity, such as documenting a multi-line regular expression.

The use of inline comments should be limited, because their existence is typically a sign of a code smell. Especially do not use inline comments when they state the obvious.

``` coffeescript
  # No

  # Increment x
  x = x + 1
```

However, inline comments can be useful in certain scenarios:

``` coffeescript
  # Yes

  # Compensate for border
  x = x + 1
```

### Annotations

Use annotations when necessary to describe a specific action that must be taken against the indicated block of code.

Write the annotation on the line immediately above the code that the annotation is describing.

Follow the annotation keyword by a colon and a space, and a descriptive note.

```coffeescript
  # FIXME: The client's current state should *not* affect payload processing.
  resetClientState()
  processPayload()
```

If multiple lines are required by the description, indent subsequent lines with two spaces:

```coffeescript
  # TODO: Ensure that the value returned by this call falls within a certain
  #   range, or throw an exception.
  analyze()
```

Annotation types:

  - `TODO`: describe missing functionality that should be added at a later date
  - `FIXME`: describe broken code that must be fixed
  - `HACK`: describe the use of a questionable coding practice
  - `OPTIMIZE`: describe code that is inefficient and may become a bottleneck
  - `REVIEW`: describe code that should be reviewed to confirm implementation

## Inline documentation

Use [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) to document functions and types inline. All public interfaces should be annotated.

  - [JSDoc documentation](http://usejsdoc.org/)
  - [Annotating JavaScript for the Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler)

Installing [DocBlockr](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs) is recommended for Sublime Text.

In CoffeeScript, block comments that get passed through use triple-hashes, so a JSDoc annoation in CoffeeScript looks like:

```
###*
 * A tasty treat with a hole
 * @param {string} flavor Name of the flavor
 * @constructor
###
Donut = (@flavor) ->

###*
 * Decorate a donut
 * @param {Donut} donut The donut to decorate
 * @param {Object} [options] Options for decorating the donut
 * @param {boolean} [options.needsSprinkles] Whether the donut needs sprinkles
 * @param {boolean} [options.needsGlaze] Whether the donut needs glaze
 * @return {Donut} The decorated donut
###
decorateDonut = (donut, options = {}) ->
  # ...
```

### Return values

CoffeeScript implicitly returns the last line of a function. For clarity, explicitly write out `return` if a function does not fit on a single line and its return value is important.

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**


## Types

V8 and modern JavaScript compilers can better optimize code when objects follow more regular type structures. In addition, Chrome's memory profiling tools provide more rapid debugging and more useful insights when objects are of named types.

Thus, when objects are created with a regular set of properties, using a constructor is preferred to object literals. This is especially important for long-lived objects and objects that act as maps, since these are more likely to be involved in memory leaks. However, using object literals is OK for boxing up multiple arguments to get immediately parsed out and irregular blobs of data.

For performance reasons, the properties of a typed object should not be changed after instantiation. New properties should not be added dynamically, and properties should not be removed with a `delete` statement. Instead, properties that are only sometimes existant should be initialized to `null` and cleared via a set to `null`. Adding properties dynamically and `delete` should ideally only be used on objects that act as maps.

Arrays should be avoided as containers of mixed values, and they should only be used to contain lists of a single type.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  library =
    isbnMap: {}

  library.add = (book) ->
    @isbnMap[book.isbn] = book

  library.add {
    isbn: '978-1470178192'
    title: 'Moby Dick'
    author: 'Herman Melville'
  }

  # Yes
  Book = (@isbn, @title, @author) ->
  IsbnMap = ->
  Library = ->
    @isbnMap = new IsbnMap

  Library::add = (book) ->
    @isbnMap[book.isbn] = book

  library = new Library

  isbn = '978-1470178192'
  title = 'Moby Dick'
  author = 'Herman Melville'
  library.add new Book(isbn, title, author)
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**


## Conditionals

Always use `if` instead of `unless` when there is an `else`.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  unless false
    ...
  else
    ...

  # Yes
  if true
    ...
  else
    ...
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**


## Loops and comprehensions

Prefer comprehensions for map and filter tasks.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  results = []
  for item in array
    results.push item.name

  # No
  results = array.map (item) -> item.name

  # Yes
  results = (item.name for item in array)
```

Use for loops and not Array#forEach in cases where a closure wrapper is not needed.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  items.forEach (item) ->
    console.log item

  # Yes
  for item in items
    console.log item
```

If a closure wrapper is needed when iterating over an array, use Array#forEach instead of the CoffeeScript `do` keyword.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  for filename in files
    do (filename) ->
      fs.readFile filename, (err, contents) ->
        compile filename, contents.toString()

  # Yes
  files.forEach (filename) ->
    fs.readFile filename, (err, contents) ->
      compile filename, contents.toString()
```

## Modules

Use the Node.js module convention for both server and client code. Each module is a file. Modules may export an object with stateless methods, a single function, or a constructor.

### Requires

Place require statements at the top of a file. Group them in the following order:

  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third party library imports
  3. Local imports

When using imported functions, don't destructure them at the top of the file.

``` coffeescript
  # No
  {join} = require 'path'
  join __dirname, '/foo'

  # Yes
  path = require 'path'
  path.join __dirname, '/foo'
```

### Modules that export an object

Modules that export an object have a camel case name starting with a lowercase letter. Where either singular or plural would make sense, pluaral names are preferred.

They only export stateless functions and global constants shared among all instances of the module. Public exported functions start with a lowercase letter, and functions exported for internal use start with an underscore.

Modules that export an object only use `exports` and they do NOT use `module.exports`. All exported functions are exported where they are defined. Use of exported functions in the same file also refer to the function as `exports.xxx`.

**`fruits.coffee`**

``` coffeescript
  exports.TIMEOUT = 1000

  exports.ripen = (fruit, amount) ->
    fruit.ripeness *= amount

  exports.ripenEach = (fruits, amount) ->
    for fruit in fruits
      exports.ripen fruit, amount
    return
```

### Modules that export a function or constructor

Modules that export a function or constructor are named the same thing as the function they export. Modules exporting a constructor start with an uppercase character.

They always export using `exports = module.exports =`.

**`Fruit.coffee`**

``` coffeescript
  exports = module.exports = (@name) ->
    @ripeness = 0
    return

  exports::isRipe = ->
    return @ripeness > 0.5
```
